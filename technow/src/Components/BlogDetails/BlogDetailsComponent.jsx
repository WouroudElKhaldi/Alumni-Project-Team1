                         As of this writing, movie writers and actors are on full strike, 
                         and the United Auto Workers seem to be on track to shut down U.S. domestic automobile production at a time when the car industry is in deep trouble.
                         Air transportation workers are about to go out on strike as well.
                         The total impact of these strikes could be devastating on a national level,
                         with AI and massive compensation disparities between CEOs and other employees cited as major contributing factors.
                        Human resources (HR) should be one of the protections against this kind of employee collective action. However, for years, 
                        it has been more of a compliance organization that works to cover up executive mistakes rather than taking care of employees.
                        AI could have a huge positive impact on work/life balance, 
                        fair compensation, and turning companies into better workplaces. 
                        Still, too often, AI is positioned as a threat to employees instead of a benefit.
                        Let'    s talk about the potential of AI to improve employee-employer relations and help executives make better decisions. 
                        Then we'll close with my Product of the Week: a new handheld gaming system from Lenovo powered by AMD.
                        Embracing IBM's AI concept
                        IBM has been outspoken about using AI to enhance rather than replace employees,
                        and companies planning to use AI should take this concept to heart.
                        Take the actors and writers strike, for instance. 
                        The movie industry has had several very high-priced failures of late. These weren’t the actors’ fault, 
                        and while you could blame the writers, 
                        often it was studio decisions that changed the scripts or directors that didn’t seem to understand the subject material that was the cause.
                        Executives make bad decisions all the time for a variety of reasons. Often, the reason is that they prioritize showcasing 
                        their authority over someone more qualified to make the decision as some kind of power play.
                        Assuring the success of movies and TV shows more effectively could substantially reduce the pressure to replace actors and writers with artificial intelligence.
                        The total impact of these strikes could be devastating on a national level,
                         with AI and massive compensation disparities between CEOs and other employees cited as major contributing factors.
